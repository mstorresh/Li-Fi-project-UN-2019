# Abstract: 

In this work, a system for transmitting and receiving information through light modulation in the visible range that is capable of transmitting digital data using a Beaglebone Green is developed. To do this, first a simple assembly of a diode and a photodiode is made to measure the reception of visible light. Then, an LM741CN amplifier is implemented in the diode, photodiode assembly. Next, the receiver circuit is connected to the Beaglebone reduced board computer through a 1.8 V Zener diode. At the same time, the code is designed for signal processing to information to be interpreted by the Beaglebone, emphasizing the measurement of the LED reaction frequency. Finally, binary signals are transmitted through the VLC transceiver. Binary and grayscale images are transmitted.
